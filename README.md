The objective of this project is to develop a web application that uses a predictive model for estimating car prices in the European marker based on various vehicle attributes. Data for the project was sourced through API requests to Carvago, a leading car aggregator platform in Europe, and subsequently stored in a MySQL database. An initial exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify key features likely to impact the price of a car. This notebook focuces on feature exploration and model training.

For the predictive modeling XGBoost regression was chosen because this model showed comparable performance to neural-network based models in similar tasks and is better optimized for handling datasets with multiple correlated features and missing values, thereby requiring less preprocessin. The model was improved by selecting best hyperparameters using grid search technique.

The final XGBoost model exhibited strong performance in predicting car prices on a test set comprising 215,211 items. The model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3,086 on the test set. This implies that, on average, the model's price estimations deviated from the actual listing prices by approximately 3,000 EUR.
